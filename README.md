# Rulkov-Map-of-Neurons
Rulkov Map is a 2-D discrete non-linear dynamical system built with an ability to describe the behaviour of neuron. Three of the main activities exhibited by neuron are quiescence, spiking and bursting. Quiescence is the silent period with no external input also known as the resting stage of neuron when the action potential is maintained at -70. Spiking is the firing of neuronal action potential with single input signal. Bursting can be called as continuous or a group of firing of action potential which may lead to chaos in the system.

All the .mlx files included here have been created in MATLAB version R2021a.
